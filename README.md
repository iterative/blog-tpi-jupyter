# Terraform Provider Iterative + Jupyter + Tensorboard

Painlessly deploy an ML-ready Jupyter server and sync results with your favourite cloud compute provider.

## Requirements

`terraform` plus some environment variables:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `NGROK_TOKEN`
- `JUPYTER_PASSWORD`

Alternatively could use Azure, GCP, or k8s.
